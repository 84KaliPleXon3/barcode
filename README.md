# barcode
scanning barcode(hardware) using python and storing it in database

initially you need to create a databse and a table in mysql

make sure your system has 
            xampp if you are using windows 
            orelse 
            if u are using linux system then install apache2, mysql, php, php-msql, phpmyadmin, python, python-mysql.
            
            
My plan here is reading the barcode through python and printing the database contents using PHP.
